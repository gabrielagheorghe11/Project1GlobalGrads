            <h4>What to discover in Sagrada Familia?</h4>
            <p >The most famous sight and tourist attraction is certainly the historic church Sagrada Familia (In Spanish Basílica y Templo Expiatorio de la Sagrada Família) in the l'Eixample district. The name means basilica and the expiatory church of the Holy Family. This beautiful, unfinished church was designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
                Construction of this holy church started on 19 March 1882. Initially it was based on the plans by architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, but in 1883, architect Antoni Gaudí was given the task to continue construction of the Sagrada Família. After Gaudi received an anonymous donation, he decided to replace the original Gothic Revival design with a more modern and innovative temple design. The only time construction was halted for a few years was during the Spanish Civil War. Until his death in 1926, Gaudi worked on the temple, and several architects have succeeded him since.

                <h4>What to discover in Alcazar de Sevilla?</h4>
                <p> The Real Alcázar de Sevilla is the Royal Palace of Seville. The name 'Alcazar' means castle in Spanish and is derived from the Arabic word al-qasr (fortress or palace).
                    The complex of palaces is in the Mudéjar style, which is a architectural style with many influences from Moorish and Christian culture.
                    It is probably the oldest palace still in use in Europe; when King Felipe V visits Seville, this UNESCO-listed palace is still his residence

                <h4>What to discover in Setenil de las Bodegas?</h4>
                <p>The municipal area is located in the north east of the province, in the continuation of the Ronda Valley, and its landscape comprises gently undulating fields of cereals and olive trees, across which the River Guadalporcun flows.
                    The village stands on a slope which cascades down from the Castle alongside the river. Its main attraction lies in the beauty and originality of its streets, particularly in the lower part, where the houses,
                    in the manner of semi-troglodytic dwellings, take advantage of the shelter of the rocks in the gorge created by the river. 
                    Also of interest are the fortress and La Encarnacion Church.
